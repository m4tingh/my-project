# AI Projects
This repository contains simple AI projects that I work on (just like a personal sandbox ヾ(⌐■_■)ノ). Each project demonstrates different aspects of artificial intelligence, from basic machine learning models to more advanced algorithms. The goal is to explore and learn various AI techniques while creating useful applications.




# Projects:
## Project 1: word counter
## Project 2: linear regression and logistic regression
