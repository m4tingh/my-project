#Word Counter with NLTK
This Python project uses the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library to tokenize input text and count the number of words. It handles common punctuation marks and ensures they are excluded from the word count.









#Libraries Used:
nltk for tokenization and text processing.
Standard Python libraries (os, etc.) for managing paths and file operations.
